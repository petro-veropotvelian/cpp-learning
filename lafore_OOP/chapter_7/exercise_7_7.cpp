// exercise_7_7.cpp
// One of the weaknesses of C++ for writing business programs is that it does
// not contain a built-in type for monetary values such as $173,698,001.32.
// Such a money type should be able to store a number with a fixed decimal
// point and about 17 digits of precision, which is enough to handle the
// national debt in dollars and cents. Fortunately, the built-in C++ type long
// double has 19 digits of precision, so we can use it as the basis of a money
// class, even though it uses a floating decimal. However, we'll need to add
// the capability to input and output money amounts preceded by a dollar sign
// and divided by commas into groups of three digits; this makes it much easier
// to read large numbers. As a first step toward developing such a class, write
// a function called mstold() that takes a money string, a string representing
// a money amount like "$1,234,567,890,123.99" as an argument, and returns the
// equivalent long double.
// You'll need to treat the money string as an array of characters, and go
// through it character by character, copying only digits (1–9) and the decimal
// point into another string. Ignore everything else, including the dollar sign
// and the commas. You can then use the _atold() library function (note the
// initial underscore—header file STDLIB.H or MATH.H) to convert the resulting
// pure string to a long double. Assume that money values will never be
// negative. Write a main() program to test mstold() by repeatedly obtaining a
// money string from the user and displaying the corresponding long double.
